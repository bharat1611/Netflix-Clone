## Netflix Clone 
Hey there!! This is clone of the popular streaming app Netflix using Reactjs, HTML, CSS, and Firebase.
In this, I have replicated the core features and UI/UX of ’Netflix’, including user authentication, browsing, and video playback, and functionalities across various devices making it extremely responsive, seamless and interactive.
